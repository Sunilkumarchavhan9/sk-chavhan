# Day 1 - Building Real-time Drawing App: Lessons Learned

## What I Did Today

Today I worked on building a real-time collaborative drawing application. I encountered several challenges with WebSocket connections, database relationships, and error handling that taught me important lessons about building real-time applications.

## Lessons Learned

### Type Safety
- **Always validate data types when working with databases**
- Learned the hard way that Prisma requires proper type definitions
- Missing required fields can cause silent failures

### Error Handling
- **WebSocket connections fail silently - proper error handling is crucial**
- Implemented proper error boundaries and connection state management
- Added retry mechanisms for dropped connections

### Prisma Relations
- **Understanding foreign key relationships and required fields**
- Learned how to properly set up one-to-many and many-to-many relationships
- Importance of cascade deletes and referential integrity

### Real-time Architecture
- **Separating HTTP and WebSocket concerns for different use cases**
- HTTP for initial data loading and authentication
- WebSocket for real-time drawing updates and collaboration

## Code Snippet of the Day

```typescript
// WebSocket connection with proper error handling
const socket = new WebSocket(WS_URL);

socket.onopen = () => {
  console.log('Connected to drawing room');
  setIsConnected(true);
};

socket.onerror = (error) => {
  console.error('WebSocket error:', error);
  setIsConnected(false);
  // Implement retry logic
};

socket.onclose = () => {
  console.log('Connection closed');
  setIsConnected(false);
  // Attempt to reconnect
};
```

## Next Steps

- [ ] **Implement user authentication**
  - Add JWT tokens for secure user sessions
  - Implement login/logout functionality
  
- [ ] **Add drawing tools**
  - Brush tool with different sizes
  - Shape tools (rectangle, circle, line)
  - Color picker and palette
  
- [ ] **Optimize WebSocket message handling**
  - Implement message queuing for offline scenarios
  - Add message compression for better performance
  
- [ ] **Add room management features**
  - Create/join drawing rooms
  - User permissions and roles
  - Room persistence and history

## Reflection

Building real-time applications is more complex than I initially thought. The combination of WebSocket connections, database relationships, and error handling requires careful planning. I'm excited to continue improving this project and implementing the next features.
